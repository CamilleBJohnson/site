           <h2> Math Rock Favorites </h2>
           <p> Generally, I gravitate towards 90sâ€“00s math rock. If you aren't super familiar with math rock, it's rather quirky. I am by no means knowledgeable about music, so my descriptions may be poor. But I would say math rock tends to have varying sounds (within one song) with irregular or complex rhythms. Many of the songs have minimal singing. One of my favorite math rock bands, Slint, has a lot of talking in songs (not singing). Their music is a bit sinister, quiet, and tells some pretty cool stories. </p>
            <p> I like math rock because it feels like poetry (or maybe more like epics?). I know people would probably describe a lot of music as poetry, but to me, math rock seems especially so. Overall, I'm not the most knowledgeable about math rock since I only recently got into it, but I would recommend giving it a listen. I think it's quite good (you don't say?), but I could also completely understand someone not liking it at all. Totally an acquired taste. In the rare event a math rock critic stumbles upon this, this is a general list I think some non-math rock people could possibly vibe with! Not the most obscure songs (in fact they are quite popular). These are just some songs that got me into it so maybe it will get others into it as well. </p> 
           <ul>
            <li> "Washer" by Slint </li> 
            <li> "Thermal Treasure" by Polvo </li> 
            <li> "In the absense of strong evidence..." by Don Caballero </li> 
            <li> "Breadcrumb Trail" by Slint </li> 
            <li> "So Say We All" by Delta Sleep </li> 
            <li> "It's not true Rufus, Don't... " by TTNG </li> 
            <li> "Stupid Puma" by Don Caballero </li> 
            <li>  Basically all of Spiderland by Slint </li>

           <h2> Shoegaze/Dream Pop Favorites </h2>
           <p> Huge shoegaze fan. Yes shoegaze and dreampop are not synonyms but womp womp womp I don't care too many bands are shoegaze slash dreampop so you'll have to cope with me grouping them together. I'm not even going to try to describe shoegaze/dreampop from a music standpoint, but I will say that it's like driving at midnight on a winter night with the windows and sun roof open, one hand out the window, and mist making the inside of your car wet.</p>
            <p> I don't know how many people are into searching other people's playlists, but I am quite fond of it. Many of my best shoegaze/dreampop songs are ripped straight from a couple people's spotify pages. Maybe now you'll understand why my shoegaze/dreampop playlist is title "reflection nebula." Perhaps it's weird to do look through other's playlists (or maybe to admit it). But to me, listening to the playlists others have made of the songs they love is a fun way to discover new music. Hence this page--so maybe someone will find new music through me.  </p> 
           <ul>
            <li> "Cherry Stars Collide" by Swallow </li>
