  <h1>My Tiny Pencils</h1>

  <h2>"Do you not have any other pencils?"</h2>
  <p>Nope! I have other pencils. I just grind all my pencils down to the nub. If you don't like it, then cope. </p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>For starters, I am pretty anti-grades. I believe they cannot tell the full picture of how hard someone works. Perhaps someone studies endlessly, then has an off test day. It happens. Also, I don't believe in "studying for a grade." Or whatever that even means. Instead, I chose to represent my work in pencils. When I work hard (and study with pencils), I inevitably grind my pencils down. Thus, no matter what grade I get, my pencils tell that I worked hard. And that's all I care about.</p>
  <p>Yes, there are lots of flaws in this system. "What if I study on the computer?" "What if I don't work hard but still get a blah blah blah blah..." I don't care. It's mostly for my work in math and physics, because I always study with pencil (if not on chalkboard) and those are the subjects I care the most about.</p>
  <p> Moreover! I love how the graphite gets all over my hands when I write in pencil. I get the same feeling when I use (Hagoromo) chalk. When I finish a study session and my hands are covered in graphite or chalk dust, it feels symbolic of my hard work—I find it beautiful. Perhaps to others it just dirties their hands. Oh well! Also, I have a superstition: I can't empty my pencil case out until the night before a math test. So, my pencil case (and by extension all my belongings since my pencil case is a 7-year-old dented tin tomb that pops open on its own) are pretty much covered in graphite. I think it's cool.</p>

  <h2>A shrine for my tiny pencils</h2>
  <p>At the end of high school, I made a box for all the tiny pencils I had produced. Granted, when something is sub-3 centimeters, it gets easy to lose, so I did lose a few. However, I ended high school with a clean 20 tiny pencils. My dad then helped me make this neat box to hold my pencils! And I gave it to my favorite teacher because he supported me so much throughout high school, and I wouldn't have made those pencils without him.</p>

  <h2>A bit of writing I did on my tiny pencils back in high school:</h2>
  <p>(My Common App personal statement) </p>
  <div class="fact">
    <p>"I scratch my pencil into my notebook as I eagerly take notes on every word the astronomy teacher says through my computer. An elaborate image of Higgs Boson slowly forms on my notebook page as the night grows, glistening in the lamplight illuminating my room because dull pencil markings shine extra bright. My pencil is dull because it is 2.5 centimeters, and can’t be sharpened with a normal pencil sharpener. Of course, I do have larger “normal” sized pencils as well, but I prefer my small pencils—the ones I have to grip differently, that leave graphite all over my fingers, and that rattle like pebbles in my tin pencil box. I get lots of funny looks and my friends, teachers, and family have all called my pencils “ridiculous.” However, I don’t use them because they are small. I use them because they are a symbol of my determination, curiosity, and effort.</p>
    <p> These pencils tell the story of my struggles and triumphs when precalculus and calculus challenged me like no other math classes had before, and math no longer seemed to come naturally to me. I would try new study methods, scribbling down math problems for hours and attempting every problem I could find, or explaining the lessons to anyone who was willing to listen. With time and dedication, I would understand the problems, but I would always be left with a new curiosity and a restless desire to learn more, to go deeper.</p> 
    <p> They were ground down to nubs when I sat for hours at my computer over summers and school breaks taking Coursera and EdX courses on physics and astronomy, seeking answers to my endless questions about why the universe is what it is and how it came to be. My desk was littered with pencil spirals, as I spiraled down from stars, space, and astrophysics to particle physics, elementary particles, and neutrinos—because every new topic sparked new questions that I needed answers to. The more I learn, the more I yearn to understand physics and be able to answer unsolvable questions about our universe. </p> 
    <p> The hand cramps and calluses on my fingers that I get from my pencils are really no different from the sunburns and sore arms I have gotten from working at the foodbank on Saturdays since freshman year, loading cars with fresh groceries for people in need. I began volunteering because of my school, but before long, I fell in love with the foodbank and being a part of the community. Three years ago, I wouldn’t have imagined that the other volunteers and I would bring in treats to celebrate each other's birthdays during our 10-minute breaks. We bonded over a desire to give others not just food, but a reason to smile.  </p> 
    <p>The graphite dust and pencil scraps on my desks are the same as the flour and dough on my countertops, and in each case, the mess is always worth it. When my best friend told me her favorite dessert was macarons, I spent hours making and altering the recipe over and over again; I dedicated myself to perfecting my macarons for her. No level of mess can ever deter me from baking, because everything pays off once I have mastered a baked good.</p> 
    <p> I will never stop using pencils to the nub. I will wear them down studying math, physics, and astronomy in college, and beyond college as I continue to learn, research, and solve problems. My curiosity will keep driving me to conquer challenges and understand what I do not know. I will forever be tirelessly committed to the things I love."</p>
