  <h1>k.d. lang</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>k.d. lang is a Canadian pop and country singer-songwriter. She has one of the most beautiful singing voices ever. She has very crooner-style vocals. For people of my generation who have never heard of her: she is famous! People know her! When I would tell my friends in high school I loved k.d. lang, everyone would try to convince me that she was not famous/no one knew her. That could not be more wrong. I would argue that most Americans/Canadians who listen to music and know anything about pop-culture and who are over 50 (yes I just narrowed the range down a lot) know k.d. lang. </p>

  <h2>I'm going to tell you about my love of k.d. lang now</h2>
    <p>I think I got into k.d. lang around late September/early October of 2023. I developed a severe problem shortly thereafter. I do not think anyone can fully fathom the scale that I get into things. For reference though, it was so bad that I listened to so much k.d. lang that she sored to becoming my top artist of 2023 even though Spotify closed the year in wrapped data collection on October 31st. I listened to 15,000 minutes of k.d. lang. That's 250 hours. That's 8 hours a day for 31 days straight. I kid you not I ONLY listened to her for all of October. And on top of that almost every day I would go home and watch the same 20 k.d. lang interviews. Dude. I actually have a problem. But I will never stop loving k.d. lang. </p>
    <p>My biggest flex is that I own a copy of her famous Vanity Fair August 1993 magazine with Cindy Crawford. I scored it on ebay. And I love it so much. I love k.d. lang so much. I love how artistic she is. I love her music. I love her lyrics. I love her voice. I love her discography. I love her so much. I wish more people my age knew about her and knew about how amazing and fun and awesome and poetic she is. And I wish she would perform again (near me, though). Gosh. I'm getting distracted writing this. Also, her music (specifically Ingenue) is the PERFECT autumn soundtrack. It is so autumn. </p>
    <p>In summary: I love k.d. lang. Please give her album Ingenue a listen (I think it's her most palatable album). And watch this video here, it really shows off her vocals. </p>
