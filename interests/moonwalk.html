  <h1>Moonwalking (New Year's Goal)</h1>

  <h2>My Resolution</h2>
  <p>My 2025 New Year's Resolution is to learn how to Moonwalk. I practice at any point I remember that it's my goal. Albeit, I don't remember it very often. My progress, you ask? Well... I think because I never truly practice I don't often make progress, so I am still pretty bad at it. I bet if I just locked in for an hour or two I could learn, but that would be boring. </p>
  <p>One thing to note is that this was also my New Year's Resolution for 2024. Evidently, I did not succeed. I also never practiced. </p>

  <h2>The Backstory</h2>
  <p>When I was younger, my sister and I were absolute just dance demons. Every Christmas, we would get the new Just Dance CD. From all my experience, I can say: one of the best CDs is "Michael Jackson: The Experience." As a kid I did not play it the most (my personal favorite was Just Dance 2014) but my sister enjoyed the Michael Jackson one. We also quite enjoyed watching music videos when we were younger, and believe me when I say we watched a lot of Michael Jackson music videos. They really are just so unmatched.</p>
  <p>In my junior year of highschool, I developed a Just Dance addiction. Around December, I had a serious problem. I would be doing homework or studying, then just get the urge to play Just Dance. And I succumbed every time. It was so bad that I would play 4 or 5 times a day. And for substantial amounts of time. But I digress. It was during this period of my life that I rediscovered "Michael Jackson: The Experience" and fell in love with it again. It is so fun. The dances are so good. I was enthralled by it. In playing those dances, I would often encounter the moonwalk or a moonwalk-adjacent move. It was then that I decided: I needed to learn how to moonwalk. How fun would it be to be talking to people, then suddenly... you just start moonwalking? I think that's so fucking hilarious. Anyway, I set it upon myself to learn how to moonwalk in 2024. Which failed because I forgot. But now, it's 2025, and I am back to make my Glorious Return. Check back in 2026 to see if it's still my New Year's Goal or if I finally succeeded. </p>
