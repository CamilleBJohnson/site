  <h1>Grape Crystal Light</h1>

  <h2>Grape What?</h2>
  <p> Grape crystal light! Why not koolaid? Or grape fanta? Or any other grape thing? Or perhaps, some drink thats not even grape at all? Who even likes grape anyway?</p>
  <p>One answer: nostalgia. I have many memories drinking grape crystal light growing up. I remember putting it in my water bottle before tennis camp then getting to taste the flavor of summer during my breaks. I remember preparing it by the pool. Taking it on end of year field trips. Etc. Importantly though, I have always been a grape-flavor-lover. </p>

  <h2>Timeline</h2>
  <p>If me being a huge fan of grape crystal light does not confuse people, my timeline on it certainly does. I restrict myself to only having it from May 1st to August 31st. There are two main reasons: </p>
  <ul> 
    <li>It is probably pretty bad for me and I thinking having it year round would pose significant risks to my health. </li>
    <li>I believe that by restricting it, I am harnessing the power of it's joy and retaining its strong tie to "summer." Because I can only have it in the summer, when I drink it, I think of the happy times of summer. Thus, when I drink it, I become happy. Call me crazy but I think I pavloved myself? I have conquered my own emotions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>"Aw man! If only I had a countdown to know how long it will be until grape crystal light season!" Oh well lucky for you, I coded a countdown! You should be grateful I just got into coding and decided to try out a variety of things!! Here you go: <a href="gcl.html">Grape Crystal Light Countdown</a></p> 


  

  <h2>Me and Grape Crystal Light!</h2>
  <p>Gosh I just love grape crystal light so much. I don't remember when my mom first bought grape crystal light for my sister and I, nor do I remember the first time I tried it, but I know I had it as a kid and loved it. I remember drinking it in the summer growing up. Then, the first time I distinctly remember the "obsession" beginning was around 2018. I would sit in bed over the summer eating grape crystal light. "Eating?" Yup. It's like a Pixie Stick! But more acidic. Also, I used to eat it much slower, and it would take me days to get through one packet. I can't say the same anymore... But that's probably when my addiction first sort of began. </p>
  <p>My parents don't know this but they'll learn it when they read this: I also remember staying up late at night (after I said good night to them! What an awful child) being on my phone while eating grape crystal light. In hindsight it is weird to eat grape crystal light at midnight in the darkness but hey if that's what kept me going! I don't do that anymore, though.</p>
  <p>Nowadays, I perhaps consume less grape crystal light. This past May, I have probably had around 1-3 packets a day? That sounds pretty high but even just two years ago I would have around 5 packets a day in early to mid May. I still love it just as much, but I am definitely more coffee inclined (and grape crystal light has caffeine) so I have less because I don't want to be consuming ABSURD amounts of caffeine. </p>
  <p>All in all, I really love grape crystal light. And I believe that my "timeline" on it helps me maintain the association of grape crystal light with the nostalgia of summertime. </p>
