    <h1>No. 2 — Over Some Years </h1>
    <h2>April 18, 2020–Oct 18, 2022</h2>
    
    <p>A rather long stretch of time! It’s a lot harder to write something cohesive when the photos span such a variety of subjects and moments.  Maybe two years is not that long, but the time I took that first shot (of the cake) felt like a very different period of my life compared to the time I took the last (the adjacent photos of the sky).</p>
    <p>Frankly, I don’t remember the stories behind many of these shots. Most were taken in Newport, but the last four are from home. I also snuck in a photo of one of my cakes because I don’t feel like I talk about baking enough on this site. It was a chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting that I made for my mom’s birthday, and it was delicious (not to be a braggart). You can spot the root beers my sister and I had in the background. That was a good day.</p>
    <p>If you’ve looked through other entries here, you might have noticed my habit of photographing the sky. Clouds, especially. I love the sky—it’s a recurring subject for me. Sorry if you’re not a fan of sky pics, though.</p>
