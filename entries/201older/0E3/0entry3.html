    <h1>No. 3 — Ecuador </h1>
    <h2>June 8–June 14, 2023</h2>
    
    <p>I went to Ecuador in 2023 on a school trip. I remember the main events: walking through the lava tunnel, seeing the giant tortoises, throwing up on the boat (yuck), spotting the Southern Cross, and wandering through small towns. However, looking back at these photos reminded me of some of my favorite moments–being alone with my camera and my thoughts. Most of the photos I took on that trip aren’t my best (I like to think I’ve improved since then), but I’m still drawn to the ones I took at twilight and into the night. I’ve always gravitated toward night photography. It’s the most difficult for me, but also the most rewarding.</p>
    <p>One day (photos from that day shown) I sat alone on the beach for maybe an hour. I remember thinking about Camus or Kafka, or both, turning over their ideas about life and absurdity. I doubt I was thinking anything very profound. I probably thought something like: “Is life truly absurd? And if it is, does that make it more or less meaningful?”</p>
    <p>That was only two years ago, but I like to think I’ve graduated from simply repeating other people’s philosophies to trying to examine, challenge, or reshape them. But who knows. I first read Kafka and Camus in eighth grade. I loved them, but I didn’t really understand them, even though I thought I did. But now, rereading those same books, I see how much I missed. And I’m sure I’m still missing a lot. Still, I read, and I think, and I sit in silence trying to understand what any of it means—or whether it means anything at all.</p>
    <p>As someone who spends a lot of time zoning out and contemplating everything, I know this kind of reflection can seem pointless. What’s the value in trying to put a framework around the world, in trying to analyze it all? I’m not sure. But I think that process—of wondering, relating, questioning, examining—is what gives my life meaning.</p>
    <p>So anyway, I guess what I’m saying is: I remember sitting on that beach and thinking about Camus or Kafka in a kind of clumsy, surface-level way, because I was too young or too naive to think much deeper. But the same is still true now. What do I know about anything?</p>
    <p>And now I am very off-track. Here are some photos of Ecuador.</p>
