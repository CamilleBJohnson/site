    <h1>No. 8 — Mathematics </h1>
    <h2>June 4, 2025</h2>
    

      <p>Mathematics has always been one of my favorite subjects. I can’t recall a year of my life when I didn’t look forward to math class. There’s something about it that has always captivated me—something about the patterns, the logic, the beauty of understanding. I cared, deeply, about my progress. Few things compare to the feeling of finally conquering a topic that once felt out of reach. I remember peering over my older sister’s homework, puzzled by the odd symbols and squiggles—and then, years later, finally understanding what an “integral” was. But in high school, math became something more. </p>
      <p>After hours upon hours of reflection, I still cannot definitively say why I love math the way I do. To some extent, I think the reason I love math is like a spiritual phenomena, and I will never be able to fully explain it. But, there are a few reasons I conjured up on why math is so special to me, so I will list those:</p>
      
      <center><p>1. The Subject Itself</p></center>
      <p>This is the most obvious point (I could probably create points a–f on this one, but I’ll keep it broad): I love math.</p>
      <p>I love the structure, the clarity, the way it rewards patience and thought. I love the abstraction and concreteness. I love its elegance. I love the creativity involved in math; math is like poetry. I know a lot of people would argue with me on these points (because I have heard it all a million times) but I stand my ground. As a quick aside, I think the reason many people struggle with math has to do with the way it’s taught and I could write another 10,000 words on how we ought to teach math but I’ll leave that for another day... At any rate, I believe that math is one of the most beautiful things to ever be discovered.</p>
      
      <center><p>2. In high school, math became challenging. </p></center>
      <p>Up until my sophomore year, I had never “struggled” in a math class before. Sure, I had been confused, I had to study, I lost points, but I never felt so lost in a course. I never felt wholly unconfident. I never felt like the math was out of reach. Then, I entered precalculus. The subjects didn’t seem hard to grasp. A unit circle. Proving trig identities. Different forms of algebraic manipulation. Polar coordinates. By all means, it was the same, straightforward math as it always was. But something was different. Maybe it was my teacher and the way he led the course and tested us, but suddenly, being familiar with the content was no longer enough to do well. </p>
      <p>I did not do great on the first few exams in the course. Not that grades matter, but it was just something I had never had to think about before. Additionally, when I took those tests, it didn’t feel right. Doing the math felt off. Whatever I had was not enough. I started studying like crazy for that class. I studied for hours for each exam (and we had them frequently). I pushed everything else away. Then one day, it clicked. I got a 100 on the exam, and it was exhilarating—but more than that, it was illuminating. Up until that moment, I had never understood what it felt like to truly understand. And I felt incredibly powerful.</p>
      <p>For the rest of the year, I chased that feeling again. The rush. The power. The knowledge. The ability to understand. And yes, there were times when I got too confident and slipped back into my old thought process of: “I will do well on the exam because I can do all the problems.” But each time I slipped, I got up again. And I remembered the beauty of knowing why. Math was addicting. </p>

      <center><p>3. A Distraction</p></center>
      <p>Meanwhile, as I chased mathematical highs, I was also unraveling. I was grieving—months late, all at once. I was deeply, quietly depressed. Most days, I couldn’t bring myself to be around my friends. When I did, I felt like a shadow. I was overwhelmed by what-ifs and sorrow and static noise.</p>
      <p>Math became my anchor; it wasn’t just that I loved learning—it was that I needed something to hold on to. Something real. Something attainable. Something to keep working for everyday. Something that moved forward even when I couldn’t. Without math, I truly believe I would have quit. It gave me structure when everything else was chaos. It gave me a reason to keep going.</p>

      <center><p>4. True Joy</p></center>
      <p>It would be unfair to say math was just a coping mechanism. That’s not the full truth. Yes, I buried myself in math because I was hurting. But I also did it because it brought me joy—real joy, not just the absence of pain. Even during those hollow years, math gave me something to feel. I felt frustrated when I didn’t understand. I felt proud when I did. I felt alive.</p>
      <p>Math became my purpose, my rhythm, my hope. It was the one part of the day I looked forward to. Maybe that sounds unhealthy. But I don’t see it as “I only lived for math”—I see it as “math gave me something to live for.”</p>

      <center><p>5. The Space</p></center>
      <p>It’s undeniable that the space and people that surrounded my high school math classes were a factor in my math experience. This is certainly where we get into the territory of “I can’t fully explain it” in my relationship with math. For some reason, the jokes were funnier. The silence was warmer. The light that filtered through the windows felt unlike any other sunlight. The breeze through the open windows behind me felt softer. Walking into room 200 felt like entering a protected space—somewhere the rest of my life couldn’t reach me. And room 200 felt like home.</p>

      <center><p>6. Mr. O</p></center>
      <p>Similar to “the space” I also find it difficult to describe why Mr. O was so important to me. I think, part of it is that he existed within that world—he was part of room 200, part of the reason it all mattered. But more than that, he made the experience what it was. He taught with rigor and care. He valued knowledge over grades—or at least, that’s the impression I got, though maybe I’m projecting my own values onto him.</p>
      <p>He was a tough teacher, but he was the best teacher I have ever had. He arrived early and stayed late. He challenged us. He believed in us. And in doing so, he shaped not just how and why I learned math, but how and why I learn.</p>
      <p>I respect Mr. O so deeply. Even though I’m in college now, and I haven’t been taught directly by him in over two years, I still think back on his teaching and his classes all the time. My study habits, my motivation, and my desire to learn all stemmed from his classes. I would not know how to study math and physics if I had not had his classes. While I think I would have ended up studying math or physics (generally) in college regardless, I don’t think I would have developed the same appreciation and craving for it had he not been my teacher. </p>
      <p>His classes gave me a sense of confidence. I wholeheartedly believe that if I work hard enough, I can understand anything. I know what it feels like to be utterly lost, to want to scream, to feel like your teacher is speaking an impossible language, but I will never interpret those feelings as “I can’t learn it.” </p>
      <p>If Mr. O reads this (because I’ll certainly send him the link to my website), hello! You probably already know all of this. But here is it for the thousandth time and thank you again for the millionth time for being one of the most important people in my life. And sorry for always being overly sentimental, nostalgic, and dramatic. Better than this than live like Meursault, in my opinion.</p>
