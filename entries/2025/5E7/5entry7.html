    <h1>No. 7 — Presents </h1>
    <h2>May 13, 2025</h2>
    
    <p>These are all photos from a hike I went on with two of my friends (!) It was really fun. The hiking itself was great because I love hikes, but what made it especially memorable were the bunkers and old military sites. The bunkers were originally used in the Cold War, but now they’re just abandoned structures covered in graffiti. It’s interesting to read the messages on the walls, though I’ll admit, I’m not the best at deciphering graffiti.</p>
    <p>The last abandoned building we found was the most fascinating. Structurally, it wasn’t the most unusual (it was mostly intact), but it had curtains. I don’t know who put them up, but I liked how light and airy they were. While any curtains could have worked, these ones juxtaposed the harsh concrete and rust in a way that felt oddly entrancing.</p>
    <p>At first, we explored like we explored the previous bunkers. But then we looked down and saw that someone had traced around every piece of debris, glass shard, and bit of trash on the floor in chalk. The entire floor. Is that not wild? How long must that have taken? I wish I could have known more. While I’m glad we were alone, a part of me wishes we could’ve talked to the artist. Most of the tracings still perfectly outlined their objects; only a few spots had outlines without anything left to contain. I’d love to go back and inspect it further.</p>
    <p>I really love exploring and hiking, and this one was one of my favorites. Old buildings are always fascinating to me. I do wish we went somewhere with apples, though. That’s just a personal desire of mine, I guess. I can’t explain it exactly, but there’s something oddly captivating about apples…</p>
    <p>Also, note that the date on these images is wrong. My camera was previously dead and I forgot to reset the date when I charged it up again. </p>
