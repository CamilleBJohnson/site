    <h1>No. 5 — Break Stuff </h1>
    <h2>April 25, 2025</h2>
    
    <p>These shots were all taken on a night when everyone else on campus was out. Well—still on campus, but confined within some concert venue. LW and I, however, found something better to do. But what started as a walk ended up becoming more of a fountain-adventure.</p>
    <p>Notably, LW bought a Limp Bizkit CD for our dorm (because I had mentioned it), and somehow that one gesture got “Break Stuff” stuck on loop in my head. So, when you are looking at these pictures, know one of us (probably me) was reciting the same 6 lines of “Break Stuff” as the shot was taken. Isn’t that a fun fact? </p>
    <p>I think fountains are always tempting to play in, but for some reason, that night they were extra tempting. So, we caved and played in the fountains. Then we caved again. And again. You’ll see just a bit of that in these photos.</p>
    <p>I’m sure the “real” campus event was fun, but I’m glad I missed it. There was something so special and so cinematic about that night that I wouldn't trade for anything.</p>
