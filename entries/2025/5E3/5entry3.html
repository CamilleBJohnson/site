    <h1>No. 3 — Wandering </h1>
    <h2>February 9, 2025</h2>

    <p>I took all of these shots on a day I was just wandering around campus. Well, more of an evening. I don’t remember much else from that day, except the heavy sluggishness that hung over me. That feeling when everything is like trying to jam the wrong puzzle piece into place. But worse.</p>
    <p>Even though the day felt off, I really like a lot of these images. I think sometimes, on bad days, we produce our best art. For example: would I have stopped to sit on the bench outside the chapel, watching the trees twist above me like veins, if I hadn’t been trying to drown myself in my own misery by sitting out in 30º weather? Likely not. And it was only in those quiet, shivering moments that I noticed how beautifully the lamp glowed behind those vein-like branches. So, I took the shot. Or a couple dozen.</p>
    <p>I really like a lot of these shots, even if they're pretty dark and hard to make out. I love the collegiate Gothic style of the older campus buildings. Unbeknownst to me at the time, some of the buildings I photographed that day have since become a few of my favorites. The shot of Cupples is perhaps my favorite, though there's a special charm about each one. </p>
