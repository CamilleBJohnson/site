    <h1>No. 4 — Veins </h1>
    <h2>March 16, 2025</h2>

    <p>I’ve always liked this time of winter, when the world begins to still. When the leaves have fallen and the trees, now bare, no longer sway but instead seem to brace themselves against the wind. There’s something quietly remarkable about such stillness. It was around this time of year, I think, that I first began to notice it.</p>
    <p>I remember walking past a branch one evening. I kept my eyes fixed on it as I approached, passed beneath, and moved beyond it. The branch remained motionless, frozen in the air, while everything else—the grass, the clouds, the sunlight—shifted around me. And the branch, in all its stillness, began to seem strangely unreal. As though it had been placed there, like a prop in a play, and not grown from any tree at all.</p>
    <p>That sentiment stuck with me. I began to notice how, when you look closely enough, everything starts to appear a little false. Oddly positioned, as if the world itself is a set, and I am simply walking through it, moving from scene to scene. After a while, it no longer feels like I live <em>in</em> the world so much as I pass <em>through</em> it.</p>
    <p>Everything starts to blend together. The veins in my arm resemble the strands of pith in a tangerine, or the frozen tree branches overhead. Things begin to echo each other, to repeat, until it becomes difficult to tell what belongs to what: where one thing ends and another begins. And suddenly, it becomes impossibly difficult to distinguish reality.</p>
