    <h1>No. 1 — Yosemite </h1>
    <h2>June 3–June 5, 2024</h2>
    
    <p>My dad and I went to Yosemite the week after I graduated high school. It was a last minute trip—planned the week prior—but it was really fun. I had been to Yosemite before but only when I was really young, so I did not remember much of it. My favorite hike for hike’s sake was Vernal Falls/JM trail. However, for views and experience’s sake, I enjoyed going up to Taft Point. It was kind of extremely scary to look over and see nothing but a massive drop. Or to be walking on rocks then you look to your left and there’s a massive fissure right next to you. Still, it was so incredibly cool to be up there. My dad and I also went later in the day so the sky was beautiful.</p>
    <p>Finally, for photography’s sake, I liked Sentinel Dome the best. We got there after going to Taft Point and watched the sunset from the dome. At the time, it was the most beautiful sunset I had seen (but that was usurped by Joshua Tree one week later). I really like the shots I got from that evening, and I have to admit that my computer background is a photo of the sunset from Sentinel Dome.</p>
    <p>I am hoping (!) to go back sometime in the next year, because Yosemite truly is an incredible place.</p>
