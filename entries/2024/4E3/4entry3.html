    <h1>No. 3 — A December Walk</h1>
    <h2>December 15, 2024</h2>
    
    <p>I went on a walk in mid-December during my last few days on campus before break. I did not take many photos, so I had to add some pretty similar shots to get the formatting I wanted. If you were curious, I listened to “The Secret History” by Kerry Muzzey, “Reflections” by Toshifumi Hinata, and “Clair de Lune” by Claude Debussy, as I took these.</p>
