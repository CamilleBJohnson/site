    <h1>No. 2 — Joshua Tree </h1>
    <h2>June 10–June 13, 2024</h2>
    
    <p>My friends and I went to Joshua Tree the summer after senior year. The drive was long, but the trip was worth it. I had wanted to go for a while—mostly to stargaze—and I was glad I got to do it with them. I had just finished On the Road by Jack Kerouac, so the timing made it all feel a bit cinematic, like I was briefly living that transient, open-road life, driving across America (though it was just California).</p>
    <p>My favorite part of the trip was stargazing, and the sunset. Looking back at the photos, it’s probably obvious how much I loved the sunset. As is also evidenced by the photos, I was very fixated on a sole Joshua Tree up on a mountain; something about how it stood alone, a flat black against the colorful sunset, struck me. I couldn’t get any good star photos on my camera (night photography is harder than it looks), so I included a few shots from KS’s iPhone just to mark that part of the trip.</p>
    <p>There’s something about desert stillness, especially at night, that makes you think a little more deeply than usual. Maybe that’s why Joshua Tree felt so surreal. Or maybe I was just 18 and romanticizing everything. And maybe now I am only 19, still romanticizing everything. Either way, I’m glad I went.</p>
