    <h1>No. 5 — Moments of Them</h1>
    <h2>December 21, 2024</h2>
    
    <p>Yet more time spent with my friends… These are all taken on a day when the six (!) of us hung out at KS’s house. K’s house is the designated house we all hang out at. I liked this day a lot because it was just us. It’s nice to have activities like legos or gingerbread house decorating to do with your friends, but there is something so special about having people you can just exist around. I think that’s what makes this friendship so special. </p>
    <p>I have not been in many friendgroups. I guess I just lied, actually, since I have had trios and groups of people I hung around, but still I had never had a “group” before meeting my friends. So, I don’t have much to compare us to. Still, I’d die on the hill that what we have is special. I don’t know how many people I would feel comfortable (or how many friend groups would feel comfortable) sprawling over on a couch with. Yet every hang out at KS’s seems to end like that. </p>
    <p>One of my favorite bits to do with my friends is to lie to them. They are certainly not all gullible, but HL and I have found that if we are strategic about who we lie to / prank first, we can get them all. My personal favorite example to give is when we told the rest of them that the reason we had left (for 15 minutes–by the way) was because we got hungry and ate dinner (all 5 of us had plans to get dinner together later in the day). Because we were strategic, they all ended up believing us… though it really would have been impossible for us to leave for 15 minutes and get dinner, given location and traffic. They were really upset at us that we ate dinner without them and they did not find it funny when we told them it was a prank. However, they did prank us back one day.</p>
    <p>That is probably one of the few effective pranks we ever did. Other, not so effective pranks, were “pretending to be asleep when camping” (they didn’t notice but we found it funny), “telling KS we could only eat canned soup when we went camping” (somewhat effective), or “sending a video about a worm running for mayor to the group chat” (they ignored it), and countless other small things like pretending to take their food and eat it all. Those pranks are all between HL and I, but have also instigated pranks with EH, and apparently others… One time SH told me that whoever I am with, I motivate them to prank our other friends with me. Hmm. Much to reflect upon…</p>
    <p>I don’t recall pulling any pranks tonight. Though HL, EH, and I did sneak out to the grocery store while everyone else was mid-conversation—but that was more of a service to the group than a prank. Anyway, the middle row is my favorite. I think the photos are the worst, but I love my friends so much that it overpowers the poor quality of the shots.</p>
