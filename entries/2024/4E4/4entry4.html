    <h1>No. 4 — Home</h1>
    <h2>December 20, 2024</h2>
    
    <p>On my first full day back from college, I spent the day with my hometown friends. We got brunch and then drove along the back roads, surrounded by nature. It was good to be home and even better to be with them.</p>
    <p>I really love a lot of these photos. Once again, not because they’re particularly strong shots, but because of who’s in them. I’m especially drawn to the ones where my friends aren’t looking. Those moments feel the most real. When I take pictures of my friends without them knowing, I feel less like a participant and more like a quiet observer. Almost like a ghost, or a presence just outside the frame, entrusted with witnessing something almost sacred.</p>
    <p>Maybe I feel this way because I joined their group a little later. It’s not something I regret or mourn; in fact, I think there was something special about entering a space that was already so full of trust and care. Watching it all unfold—the way they laugh, talk, support, and comfort each other—feels like seeing a rare kind of friendship in bloom. Yet somehow, I was lucky enough to be welcomed into it.</p>
    <p>I’ve admired them since the early days of knowing them. They’re honest, kind, communicative, and deeply comfortable with each other. Maybe I’m biased now that I’m part of the group, but I still believe their friendship is one-of-a-kind. And maybe that’s why I still feel a bit like an observer sometimes. Not distant, just quietly aware of how precious it all is, and possibly not fully able to conceive that I am a part of it.</p>
    <p>And if all I’m ever given is the privilege to have been their friend for a wink of time, I’ll still consider myself lucky. Being there—even if only for a brief moment—has been special enough. Of course, I hope to stay close to them forever, and I hope this doesn’t read like I’m preparing to disappear. I just think there’s value in noticing something good while it’s still happening. </p>
    <p>Actually, many of these photos ended up inspiring my Christmas gifts to them. I made them all journals filled with photos of them, writing about what I loved about them, our friendship, and what it means to me. Because, if nothing else, I wanted them to know how much I’ve loved being a part of their lives. I guess, in some small way, I wanted to make something that could last forever an artifact of my gratitude.</p>
    <p>My hope is that if they ever look back at those journals, or if anyone at all ever finds those journals, they’ll know that at one point in time, someone was there for them and someone loved them so dearly. </p>
