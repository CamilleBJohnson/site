  <h1>My book recommendations</h1>
  <div class="quote">Some of my favorite books! Many of these descriptions were written circa 2022 so sorry if they are awkward.</div>
  <hr>
  <div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">On the Road — Jack Kerouac</div>
    <div class="poem-text">If you are in a transition period in your life I think this is the book to read. Notoriously hard to describe, but know it's famous for a reason. I think this book had a really big impact on me and I'm grateful I read it at the time I did (ending HS and going into college).  </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">The Remains of the Day — Kazuo Ishiguro</div>
    <div class="poem-text">A story of duty and regret. </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">5 Stories of Music and Nightfall — Kazuo Ishiguro</div>
    <div class="poem-text">Just as beautiful as The Remains of the Day. Ishiguro's writing is like the sound of silence. </div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">Crime and Punishment — Fyodor Dostoevsky</div>
    <div class="poem-text">So complex, so good, oh my gosh I loved it with all my heart. A young man and his moral scruples, philosophy, struggles, etc…  </div>
  </div>

<div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">No Longer Human — Osamu Dazai</div>
    <div class="poem-text">A very troubled man who can’t really connect/open up/live as others do. He puts a sort of mask on himself. “I had now ceased utterly to be a human being.” </div>
  </div>


<div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">Anything by Kafka</div>
    <div class="poem-text">Though my personal favorites and recommendations are: The Metamorphosis (classic), the Trial, A Hunger Artist (my favorite!), In the Penal Colony, or Poseidon. I love almost everything he writes. The one story I notably could hardly get through was The Burrow, but I think I was too young when I read it, and did not read it in the right setting. </div>
  </div>

<div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">The Stranger — Albert Camus</div>
    <div class="poem-text">This book is amazing. It's beautiful. It's so good. I have read it four times and it gets better each time. I first read it in 8th grade and it's the reason I am so into literature. A good introduction to his existential philosophy, and it really makes you ponder. The way Camus writes is amazing, he’s the master at beginning a story in my opinion. Though, I think that's better said when describing A Happy Death by Camus. That is my personal favorite beginning by Camus. Also a good recommendation. </div>
  </div>

<div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">Steppenwolf — Hermann Hesse</div>
    <div class="poem-text">Warning, Total oversimplification: man is depressed, and views himself as a subhuman/half-wolf being. Isolation, despair, madness, color, creativity, SO good. My dad said he knows a lot of Californians who like this book, oddly enough.  </div>
  </div>

<div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">Demian — Hermann Hesse</div>
    <div class="poem-text">A definite read if you know anything about Carl Jung’s “Map of the Soul.” You could psychoanalyze every detail in this book (as is common with Hesse books) but this one is pretty sick. </div>
  </div>

<div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">The Victim — Saul Bellow</div>
    <div class="poem-text">Follows a kind of common trope in books (experiencing fault and guilt without justification), but I think Saul Bellow does it expertly. A really good read.</div>
  </div>

<div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">The Dangling Man — Saul Bellow</div>
    <div class="poem-text">Guy wants to be drafted into the military—but the entire book just focuses on the waiting period; how he’s just dangling in life, waiting for that letter of enlistment. It’s also interesting to read and feel how his character progresses throughout the book. As a bonus, it's a killer reference to compare yourself to when you feel like you are in a waiting period.</div>
  </div>

<div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">If Beale Street Could Talk — James Baldwin</div>
    <div class="poem-text">A beautiful and heartbreaking love story set in Harlem. Baldwin's prose is lyrical and vibrant, and he portrays a heartbreaking story of love, injustice, and racism.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">Go Tell It On the Mountain — James Baldwin</div>
    <div class="poem-text">About a boy and his relationship with himself, his family, and the church!!! It's so good but also sad! </div>
  </div>

<div class="poem-box">
    <div class="poem-title">ANYTHING by James Baldwin honestly</div>
    <div class="poem-text">He is genuinely one of the best authors to have ever existed. His stories are poignant, emotional, gut-wrenching, and absolutely beautiful. If there is anything you read from this page let it be a James Baldwin book. I am not good at writing descriptions of writing styles, so the best way I can describe his writing is: rather than the words being printed onto paper, they read as if Baldwin carved them into the book with a knife, and now the pages are bleeding out. Truly one of the best authors.</div>
